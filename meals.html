		<h4>From the ratings and reviews, this year’s meals were our best yet. We tried a new creative process this
			year,
			but I think the main reason is that our meal planner, has grown to become a total genius at understanding
			what
			meals work best for our members.<br>
			In the spirit of the new year – and to kickstart 2022 being the year of NO EXCUSES in the kitchen – we put
			together a list of our top 10 meals of 2021.

			<h2><em>Beef and Barley Soup</em></h2>
			<p>This warm, comforting soup was our top-rated meal of 2017, proving that simple ingredients can produce
				super
				flavorful results. This recipe consists of ingredients you can find year-round, so you can make this
				dish
				anytime you crave warmth and comfort.<br><br>
				Many of our meal plan members simplified the recipe even more by making it in an Instant Pot for a quick
				weeknight dinner. (Some of our members are huge Instant Pot fans; they created a Facebook Group
				dedicated to
				converting our meal plan recipes to be Instant Pot-friendly!
