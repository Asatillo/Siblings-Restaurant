				Homegrown Creativity

		<article>
			Chef Tommy Banks’ talent is in itself truly remarkable. He was <em><b>  Britain’s youngest Michelin-starred chef</b></em>  in
			2013 and won Great British Menu in 2016 and 2017. The Michelin-starred Black Swan was awarded <em><b>‘Best
			Restaurant in the UK 2018’</b></em>  by The Food and Travel Magazine, as well <em><b>‘Best Fine Dining Restaurant in the
			World’</b></em> in 2017 and, more recently, <em><b>‘UK’s Best Fine Dining Restaurant’</b></em> in 2020 by TripAdvisor.<br><br>
			<em>
				“I see the Black Swan as a co-operative of minds. We have great people working here; some real
				characters
				with tremendous talent and it’s their coming together that creates something special. We want our guests
				to
				feel part of it and experience it with us. It’s not just a job for us, it’s a lifestyle”

				Informal Hospitality

		<article>
			During your stay you will meet many of our staff. Both the kitchen and front-of-house teams spend many hours
			working outside; they really understand what the food is and why it’s on the plate; they can tell you the
			whole story from start to finish.<br><br>
			<em>
				“I like to think that we have brushed aside much of the formality normally associated with fine dining;
				for
				us it’s about our guests having fun; so it’s good food, good service and a good time”

				edge
				and a chance to do things differently. Guests get something unique to us; our personality, our place and
